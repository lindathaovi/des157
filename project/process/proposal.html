            <h4>Abstract (ready for diffusion). 200 words maximum.</h4>
            <p>With a vast diversity of cultures around the world, there are often times tension and clashing ideologies. Isolation and existing stereotypes acts as facilitator for fear and violence between different groups. Communication is a crucial facilitator
                in our development as a society and empathy for our observed differences. A very straightforward solution is to simply communicate with each other to broaden one’s scope. The difficulty in that is the initialization and starting point
                in these conversations. SocialCue aims to eliminate the starting barrier and ease strangers into safe and open dialogue. Users are paired with a stranger from another part of the world as pen pals. The end result would form positive first
                hand experiences with people and cultures different from your own. It provides the ability to “walk in a stranger’s shoes” at your fingertips. A solution to animosity begins with communication and a larger perspective.
            </p>

            <h4>Rationale, instructional methods, and description</h4>
            <p> SocialCue addresses the Peace & Technology category, specifically in regards to intercultural dialogue. It is a pen pal app focused on facilitating deeper and more meaningful conversations between strangers with the goal of promoting cultural
                understanding and acceptance. Users will be paired with random strangers from all over the world and encouraged to talk about a wide range of subjects. Messaging will be mediated and guided with prompts and daily goals to reduce any anxiety
                or pressure associated with starting conversations with a stranger. Initial contact will begin with light subjects. Over a set amount of time, guided conversations will progress to heavier subjects that relate to their lifestyle, country,
                and ideologies. After a set amount of time and pre-set goals, both parties are encouraged to continue their conversation and relationship without predefined conversation topics. By then, users should be comfortable with each other for
                an open dialogue. The user’s end goal is to develop their own experiences with foreign cultures through interaction. Education and awareness of a broader scope develops empathy when stepping into the situation or “shoes” of another human
                being. Gradually, new relationships will continue to build as the user continues to open new dialogues with others all over the world. This is a safe and positive community inclusive to all who are willing to broaden their awareness of
                a bigger world than what is immediately tangible to them.
            </p>
