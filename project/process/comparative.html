            <h2>Comparative Research</h2>

            <p>
                For my project, I plan to develop a pen pal application that
                promotes intercultural dialouge. My mission is to connect
                strangers all over the world so that they can engage in light
                or meaningful conversations that will help open up each others
                perspective.I want people to be able to experience and understand
                how life is beyond their own scope. To be understand how to
                implement my idea, I am studying the interfaces and features of
                other apps offering a pen pal service.
            </p>

            <h3>Doonglle</h3>

            <aside class="imagerow">
              <img src="images/D1.PNG" alt="Doonglle"><img src="images/D2.PNG" alt="Doonglle">
            </aside>
            <p>The app Doonglle connects people from all over the world like how
              pen pals would work. It’s interface lightly resembles a social
              networking app in that it has a profile for each of it’s user
              accessible by other’s as well as a “story” area where you can post
              updates and images for people to see.</p>
            <br />

            At a glace their features include:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Story updates
                </li>
                <li>
                    Messenging
                </li>
                <li>
                    Matches
                </li>
                <li>
                  Live Map
                </li>
                <li>
                    Snail Mail
                </li>
            </ul>

            <aside class="imagerow">
              <img src="images/D3.PNG" alt="Doonglle"><img src="images/D4.PNG" alt="Doonglle">
            </aside>

            <p>

                They also feature a map that allows you to see people who are online and where they are located. It updates in real-time and bounces you fom location to location when other people sign on. There are buttons that allow you to edit the animations of the
                map however you prefer.

                <br /> During the setup phase, Doonglle offered many different
                preference settings depending on what type of people you wanted
                to match up with and for what reasons you were using the app.
                You can restrict the age, gender, langauge, etc.
                of the people you are matched with.
            </p>

            </aside>

            Interaction
            <p>
              When navigating through the site, it was fairly intuitive. Being
              a completely new user, it would have been nice to have alert
              bubbles that would guide a new user through the app as a quick
              introduction.

              <br /><br />
              The main menu slides out from the left and reveals all the different
              features the user can access. Something that I noticed was that in
              the messages inbox or notifications, being a new user, I didn't have
              any. Rather than displaying a messages to notify the user that there
              was nothing to display or a suggestion to start a new message, etc.
              there was only a blank page. Other than those, I thought that the
              interface was appealing and well-designed. It is quick to understand
              and the graphics are pleasing.
            </p>


            <h3>PSTMRK</h3>
            <aside class="imagerow">
              <img src="images/p1.PNG" alt="pstmrk"><img src="images/p2.PNG" alt="pstmrk">
            </aside>

            <p>POSTMRK is also a pen pal app. This one however, seems much more
            simple than Doonglle. The site map doesn't seem to be very thorough
          and the interface seems much less advanced. You are simply working with
        a pen pal matcher and an inbox and nothing more.</p>
            <br />

            At a glace their features include:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Pen pal choice
                </li>
                <li>
                    Messenging
                </li>

            </ul>

            <p>
              As a new user logging in, you create an account using facebook.
              There is not option to create an account through email which
              would have been nice. Once, your account has been set up you have
              limited setting to work with to edit your preferences which are
              name and gender.
              <br /><br />
              PSTMRK simply allows you to choose a region that you want to select
              your pen pal from. After deciding on a region, you are directed to
              a page where "cards" or images appear. You are given a name and
              their profile picture. Once you decide on who you want to walk to,
              it leads to you a blank messenger. From there, you can send a message
              to that person. There is a menu at the bottom that allows you to
              translate the converstaion, if language is a barrier for you and
              your pen pal.
                </p>

              <img src="images/p3.PNG" alt="pstmrk"><img src="images/p4.PNG" alt="pstmrk">
            </aside>

            Interaction
            <p>
              The site itself is extremely simple and so it wasn't too difficult
              to figure out what the features were and where they were. Unfortunately
              I was hoping for more complexity coming from a pen pal app that offered
              more, beyond simple messenging with strangers.

              <br /><br />
              The interface is slightly dull and the the design overall could
              use some work. The map is simple and would have been better if it
              was more animated like doongle or provided live numbers to give the
              user an idea of their scope.
            </p>

            <h3>Overall</h3>

            <p>After reviewing the two apps, I think that doonglle is more effective
            in offering a pen pal application and more. It's features adds to the
              experience which PSTMRK lacks. The ability to put yourself in perspective
              relative to where you are the the amount of people out there also looking
              to make connections across the world is awesome.
