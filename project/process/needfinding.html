            <h2>Needfinding</h2>
            <p>
                To understand a users need and a person's interaction through an app similar to what I want to develop I had a classmate go through Doonglle without giving her any information and context. Based on her interactions and thoughts about the app, I plan to
                address certain issues while developing my own.

            </p>
            <h3>Observation Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Used my own account so skipped registration to maximize time spent exploring the app.
                </li>
                <li>
                    First thing she did was go through the "story" of Doonglle. Checked out random user profiles. Has not accessed the menu/nav yet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tried to click on nationality flag but no response.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finds map feature. Dragging though the map to see new users. Finds map controls and plays around with that. The automatic jumping gets annoying and interferes with map interaction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A new user, sending a random message is not intuitive. Sees sending a random message as just sending a message to a friend. Little distinguishing details between different messaging options.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Receiving random message is not clear as well. Text at bottom of message only has poorly stylized random text. Not official or designed enough to tell user that it is a feature of the messenger not user customized message.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some icons can be redesigned to be more clear about it's function.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Brainstorm</h3>

            <p>After observing my classmate go through the app I've made notes about what improvements can be done to make it better for a new user.</p>
            <br />


            <ul>
                <li>
                    Needs to have a welcome/explore lightbox. Something instructional for the new user to familiarize themselves with the app and it's function.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Needs to redesign icons for better recognition and understanding of where it leads to
                </li>
                <li>
                    Needs to redesign how to open messenger and how to start a new message. Have all different message features in one area and then an option to choose between may help reduce confusion
                </li>
                <li>
                    Needs to have a more simple map with just penpals rather than everyone. No jumping animations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Needs small messages and details on pages to indicate that there is nothing there.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Needs to take away social media aspect. Becomes too distracting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Needs to have tooltips for new user
                </li>
                <li>
                    Needs to be more simple. Doonglle had too much going on and too many features.
                </li>
            </ul>
