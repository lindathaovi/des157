            <h2>User Goals</h2>

            <h4>How will users understand the content of the project?</h4>
            <p>My main goal from this project is to open up personal perspectives to learn more absolute people who are different from them. This app is meant to yeild understanding and acceptance in our differences and embrace our similarities. Through
                conversations with strangers, the guided conversations and pre determined topic suggestions will guide the user through a more comfortable and safe path to making conections with strangers around the world.

            </p>

            <h4>How will users understand the primary objectives?</h4>
            <p>I plan to implement tool tips that help users along a path that they mainbodyor may not choose to follow. These tips are designed to ensure that the user can get the most out of their conversations and help progress it out of surface level
                content into more deeper conversations concentrating on lifestyle, and cultural differences. Reoccuring themes and patterns will familiarize users with the intent of this pen pal app. </p>

            <h4>What content and features do users need, and in what form do they need it?</h4>
            <p>First and foremost, users will need messaging capabilities. They will be connected with another user, favorably someone who is different than them. People tend to communicate through mobile phones as many people have smartphones. Conversations
                are held through out the day across multiple days and may take time depending on location and time differences. An app makes it convenient and easy for the user to engage in conversation without requiring large amounts of time and dedication.</p>

            <h4>How do users think the interactive projects should work and what are
                their experience levels with the type of media I created?</h4>
            <p>The majority of people who have smartphones should be very familiar with messaging apps. Text message and messaging applications are heavily used in modern society and so users should be familiar enough with those existing platforms that navigating
                through SocialCue should not be difficult. The main function of the app is the messenger and everything thing else are details and information in relation to the messenger. Pathways should be simple, short and strightforward so that the
                user does not get confused while navigating through.
            </p>
