            <h2>Topic Choice</h2>

            <p>
                My goal revolves around technology and peace, specifically the
                promotion of intercultural dialouge. I want to create a pen pal app
                that encourages an open and meaningful conversation across countries,
                cultures, and religions. My concept to is to go beyond superficial
                communication with prompts and games to facilitate a deeper understanding
                of a range of things from day to day life to the political and social
                atmosphere wherever their penpal is. I want to burst that comfortable
                bubble that many of us live in, only aware of our immediate surrondings.
                The app is meant to spread awareness and empathy to happenings
                around the world, beyond subjects that relate to ourselves.
