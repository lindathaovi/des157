            <h4>Abstract (ready for diffusion). 200 words maximum.</h4>
            <p>With a vast diversity in cultures around the world, there are often times tension and clashing ideologies. Isolation and existing stereotypes acts as facilitator for fear and violence between different groups. Communication crucial facilitator
                in our development as a society and empathy for our observed differences. A very straightforward solution is to simply communicate with each other to broaden one’s scope. The difficulty in that is the initialization and starting point
                in these conversations. ______ aims to eliminate the starting barrier and ease strangers into safe and open dialogue. The end result would be forming personal positive experiences with people and cultures different from ourselves. It provides
                the ability to “walk in a stranger’s shoes” at your fingertips. The ability to come up with a solution begins with understanding the full scope of the problem.
            </p>

            <h4>General description of the Project</h4>
            <p>________ is a pen pal app focused on facilitating deeper and more meaningful conversations between strangers with the goal of promoting cultural understanding and acceptance. Users will be paired with random strangers from all over the world
                and encouraged to talk about a wide range of subjects. Messaging will be mediated and guided with prompts and daily goals to reduce any anxiety or pressure associated with starting conversations with a stranger. Initial contact will begin
                with light subjects. Over a set amount of time, guided conversations will progress to heavier subjects that relate to their lifestyle, country, and ideologies. After a set amount of time and pre-set goals, both parties are encouraged to
                continue their conversation and relationship without predefined conversation topics. By then, they should be comfortable with each other for an open dialogue. The user’s end goal is to develop their own experiences with foreign cultures
                through interaction. Education and awareness of a broader scope develops empathy when stepping into the situation or “shoes” of another human being. Gradually, new relationships will continue to build as the user continues to open new
                dialogues will others all over the world. This is a safe and positive community inclusive to all who are willing to broaden their awareness of a bigger world than what is immediately tangible to them.

            <h4>From glenda: I’m not sure what they will be asking in this field, but I imagine they will want to see how you connect your content to the ISEA call, so that is what I would like you to write here.
</h4>
            <p>My app addresses the Peace & Technology category, specifically in regards to intercultural dialogue. Its purpose is to open up personal perspectives through prompted day to day conversation with a stranger. I want to eliminate preconceived
                stereotypes through real life experiences.</p>
