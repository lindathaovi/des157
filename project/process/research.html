            <h2>Background Research</h2>

            <p style="line-height: 25px; letter-spacing:0px;">
                When designing a pen pal app targeting intercultural dialogue,
                it is important to understand the differences between cultures
                and which similarities can be used to bond them together.

                <br /><br />

                Intercultural dialogue is defined as “an open and respectful exchange
                of views between individuals, groups with different ethnic, cultural,
                religious and linguistic backgrounds and heritage on the basis of mutual
                understanding and respect” (Education to Intercultural Dialogue). To
                create a respectful and mutual environment where everyone can get along
                peacefully, there must be effective communication that brings a different
                perspective into one’s culture. There is a strong need for dialogue,
                especially now in the United States where this lacking causes fear,
                tension, and negative stereotypes which further alienate foreign
                cultures unknown to the native person. We have hostility because of
                our ignorance and refusal to understand the “ minds of a population
                whose language and politics” that differ from ours (Herchinger).
                This is not only apparent in the United States but also in many
                other counties. “The absence of dialogue deprives everyone of the
                benefit of new cultural opening, necessary for personal and social
                development in a globalized world (Education to Intercultural Dialogue).
                We must then consider how to create a respectful dialogue between
                people that hold different cultures. Despite being in a cultural
                melting pot, we can still see much tension and fear stemming
                from stereotypes perpetrated through the media and lack of
                personal understanding. The challenge is to be able to take
                someone is is willing to take a step out of their own social
                and cultural sphere and leap into a foreign concept willing
                and open to learn the rules, concepts and ideas of that new
                space. There are also barriers that prevent this type of cross
                cultural exploration due to “discrimination, poverty, and
                […] exploitation” and politics (Education to Intercultural
                Dialogue). To design something that can overstep such barriers
                would be ideal in the venture of expanding cultural awareness
                and understanding.

                <br />
                <br />

                In addition to understanding what keeps groups from engaging in
                conversation, we must understand how they understand and interpret
                interfaces. Due to the nature and form of my project, I must also
                understand how they interact with interfaces that is different than
                what I know. How to different cultures perceive certain interfaces?
                Do things that seem intuitive to one group be the same for the other?
                Are there certain cultural sensitivities that I should be aware of
                while I am designing this interface? To answer their questions, I
                must think about the 6 big differences between two cultures which
                are: “Power distance, individualism, masculinity, uncertainty
                avoidance, long-term orientation, and indulgence” (Shen).  When
                you can understand what motivates a certain culture, or if they
                tend to be more emotional expressive, or non expressive, you can
                design an interface that best fits their needs and wants.  Design
                is not always universal and understanding the differences in cultural
                interaction with technology is similar to the need for intercultural
                dialogue to create a “respectful and mutual environment” (Education
                to Intercultural Dialogue).

                <br /><br />

                As a designer I am trying to create an interface that promotes
                healthy conversation among people who differ in many aspects. My
                goal is to widen each users perspective and provide an interface
                where they can feel safe to reach out of their comfortable reach
                in an effort to cast away stereotypes formed from fear of the unknown.
